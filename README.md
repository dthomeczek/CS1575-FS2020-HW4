# Homework #4

This was the fourth coding assignment for the Fall 2020 CS1575 (Data Structures) course. The purpose of this code was designed around an array-based list (std::vector).

# Information From Assignment README

Mimic the std::vector behavior with your array-based list implementation (arraylist). When implementing your list, you must use a *dynamic array*. And you are expected to use the **same names and declarations** as defined by the STL implementation of an array list, the vector. Don't forget that the vector you implement must be templated on the data type it stores, too.

## Input/Output
Given only indirectly this time. The sample input and output are defined in terms of the behavior of the std::vector (which you must fully test yourself).
